## Roblox

Hi! Nowadays, I don't play Roblox as much as I used to. I used to play Roblox a lot from 2016 to 2020. In late 2020, I stopped playing Roblox regularly. Pretty much anything after 2020 is completely foreign to me on Roblox.

These are games I've played quite a lot through my years on Roblox:
- Tycoon games (2016-2020). I didn't play these as much after 2019.
- Vehicle Simulator (2018-2020)
- Prison Life (2016-2019) and (2021)
- Robeats (2020-2021). I now play osu!mania.

Other things I've done on Roblox.
- Namesniping (2020-2021)

In case you're curious, the word "parceling" is a real word. I changed it to this username on 04 July 2020. This username would've been pretty rare to find (before display names were a thing) because it is a real word. There are only between 200,000 to 400,000 words in the English dictionary.

For comparison, there are at least 1.6 million combinations for 4 letter usernames. My username is rarer than a 4-letter username!

I originally changed my username because my old username, "luckyboy12222222" was pretty bad and hard to remember. Even if display names would have been a thing, I may still have chosen to pay 1000 Robux to change it to the this name.

## osu!
[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) is a rhythm game you can download. There are four different modes:

1. standard
2. mania
3. taiko
4. catch

I specifically play mania. osu!mania is similar to games such as Friday Night Funkin' and Dance Dance Revolution.
